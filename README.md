# O-RAN AI-Based MAC Scheduler using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)

This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based MAC scheduler for O-RAN using AI/ML techniques.
It integrates with O-RAN RIC as an xApp and includes a simulated environment for training.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- AI-driven MAC Scheduling using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)
- Integration with O-RAN Near-RT RIC (xApp)
- Simulation Environment for Training and Testing
- Model Saving and Loading for Deployment

## ðŸš€ Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run training and simulation:
   ```sh
   python train_scheduler.py
   ```

3. Deploy xApp:
   ```sh
   python xapp/start_xapp.py
   ```
